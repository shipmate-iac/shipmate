"""Guard against stale engine-internal action pins.

The reusable workflow ``.github/workflows/apply-env-level.yml`` and the composite
actions reference sibling shipmate actions/workflows by full commit SHA. GitHub
does not allow a local ``./actions/...`` reference across the reusable-workflow
boundary -- inside a reusable workflow ``./`` resolves against the *consumer*
repo, which has no ``actions/`` dir -- so the SHA pin is the only mechanism.

The hazard: when a referenced action's code changes, these internal pins go
stale silently and the engine keeps running the OLD action. This bit the deploy
path once -- ``apply-env-level.yml`` pinned ``apply-cell`` at a pre-safeguard SHA,
so the ``--disable-safeguards=git-out-of-sync`` fix never reached post-merge
applies even after consumers re-pinned to the new engine SHA.

This test asserts every internal ``ship-iac/shipmate/<path>@<sha>`` reference
pins a commit whose ``<path>`` content matches the **mainline** (the merge-base
with ``main``), not HEAD. A difference means the pin is stale on the release
line: bump it to a commit that contains the current action (in practice, a
follow-up commit pinning the just-merged release SHA). Comparing against the
mainline -- rather than HEAD -- means a branch that edits a pinned action isn't
flagged for its own not-yet-merged change (the bump is impossible before the
change has a SHA); the guard still fires once that change reaches ``main``
without a pin bump. See ``_release_baseline``.

    A pin is a *self*-reference, so the commit that edits a pinned action can
    never also pin that action's SHA (a commit cannot pin its own unborn SHA) --
    the bump is a documented follow-up (docs/releasing.md). Comparing against
    HEAD therefore reds every branch that edits a pinned action from the first
    keystroke, which is in-flight work, not staleness. Comparing against the
    fork point (merge-base with main) instead means: the pin was current on the
    release line this branch derives from. That keeps the real guard -- once an
    action change merges to main without a pin bump, merge-base == main and the
    stale pin fails, exactly where the bump can be done -- while an in-flight
    branch that has only *its own* unmerged edits stays green. Falls back to
    HEAD when no mainline ref is reachable (shallow/detached), preserving the
    prior behavior rather than silently passing.
