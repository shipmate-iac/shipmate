"""Guard against stale engine-internal action pins.

The reusable workflow ``.github/workflows/apply-env-level.yml`` and the composite
actions reference sibling shipmate actions/workflows by full commit SHA. GitHub
does not allow a local ``./actions/...`` reference across the reusable-workflow
boundary -- inside a reusable workflow ``./`` resolves against the *consumer*
repo, which has no ``actions/`` dir -- so the SHA pin is the only mechanism.

The hazard: when a referenced action's code changes, these internal pins go
stale silently and the engine keeps running the OLD action. This bit the deploy
path once -- ``apply-env-level.yml`` pinned ``apply-cell`` at a pre-safeguard SHA,
so the ``--disable-safeguards=git-out-of-sync`` fix never reached post-merge
applies even after consumers re-pinned to the new engine SHA.

This test asserts every internal ``ship-iac/shipmate/<path>@<sha>`` reference
pins a commit whose ``<path>`` content is identical to the current tree. A
difference means the pin is stale: bump it to a commit that contains the current
action (in practice, a follow-up commit pinning the just-merged release SHA).
